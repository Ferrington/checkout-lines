# Project for Learning React

I found a prompt on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9fmr1TpKHE) and created a working app. The user inputs a number of items representing a shopping cart. The app places the shopper in the shortest line (by total items). Lines are decremented by one item every second to simulate a cashier scanning items.
